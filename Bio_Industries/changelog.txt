Version: 0.18.29
Date: 2020-11-30
  Uploaded by:
    - Pi-C

  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that some disassembling recipes were not available.
    - Fixed crash with an old migration script. (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5f5f4f358985e0b8e5ba5115)
    - Removed obsolete "per_user = false" attribute from settings. :-) (https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?p=305644#p305644)
    - Fixed that we didn't reload technologies when the configuration changed. Thus, an alternative recipe we've added for another mod would remain in the game (and be useless) even after that mod had been removed.
    - Fixed that compound entities (bio farm, cannon, powered rails etc.) placed by "Construction Drones" and similar mods reviving ghosts didn't work.  (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5f824c45b1a1a0637d24d056)

  Changes:
    - Moved recipes "Solid fuel from wood bricks", "Bio stone brick", and "Basic gas processing" from "Coal processing 1" to "Coal processing 2". These recipes can only be used in chemical plants, which are guaranteed to be available when "Coal processing 2" is researched. Also, the move gives an incentive to really use wooden bricks as fuel instead of converting them to solid fuel almost immediately.
    - Rearranged settings and unified/shortened setting names.
    - Inverted setting: "Hide electric grid overlay" for Musk floor is now "Enable: Electric grid overlay". This way, it blends in with the other settings.
    - Changed debugging routines so that debugging output is only formatted if debugging is activated. This should make the mod a bit more performant.
    - The recipe for advanced fertilizer was only unlocked if Bio Fuels were enabled per startup setting. Advanced fertilizer (as well as the bioreactor and the basic recipe for algae biomass) will always be available now, regardless of this setting. (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5ec7ff6cbe5352000eb8f875)

  Graphics:
    - Made new battery icon so it's in sync with the vanilla icon again.
    - Gave all graphics the "optipng" treatment.
    - TheSAguy provided alternative icons for use with the recipes "Bio-mass conversion 2" and "Basic gas processing" if "Angel's Petro Chemical Processing" is active.

  Localization:
    - Completely reworked localization -- no need to translate everything, using crossreferences is way easier! Also, the new descriptions should explain some things that many players apparently didn't understand.
    - Removed some obsolete strings.
    - Added German locale. Thanks to Tobilike! (https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?p=508622#p508622)
    - Fixed some typos in the English localization.
    - I've cleaned up the Russian localization by removing obsolete strings and adding placeholders for new ones. This should make work easier for translators. However, I don't speak Russian, so it would be best if somebody would look over all strings again and update them!

  Modding:
    - Added support for "Lua API global Variable Viewer (gvv)" by x2605. If that mod is active, you can inspect the global table of this mod at runtime -- just enter "/gvv" at the console, it's quite useful for debugging! (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/gvv)

  TODO:
    - Compatibility with "Tree growth: Scaled trees." (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5e7cd3f3304f21000db9542c)
    - Add an alternative way to produce plastic without fluids. (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5e3f5fadc359e6000d54cfb2)
    - Add Big gardens for absorbing more pollution. (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5f318f69f3644760ee6d001e)
    - Add "fluid fertilizer" (fertilizer + water) as alternative to the existing fertilizer. (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5f318f69f3644760ee6d001e)
    - Make algae grow on water to contain pollution there. (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5f07bed0b6dcd7af988b9fb0)
    - Just an idea: Wood harvesters like they used to be in <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/WoodHarvester>. Could harvest (only) fully grown trees planted by terraformers, and output "trees" that would have to be processed by a sawmill to make wood and wood pulp. Bio farms would also output "trees". The current bio farms already look a bit like a sawmill, so use the current pix for it and get new ones for the bio farm! This would also solve a problem with the German translation: A "Baumschule" is a tree nursery -- it's just for growing trees, not for processing them!
    - Add tar recipe if tar is available in the game.
    - Activate new Bio-Cannon (0.18.33 version)
    - control-arboretum.lua contains almost-duplicate functions (with/without water). As these are quite long, combine them and remove one copy!

  Uploaded by:

  Info:
    - All changes from 0.18.28 are also available for Factorio 0.17 (version 0.17.59). Yes, I know 0.17.58 was supposed to be the last version. But a crash needs to be fixed â€¦

  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed crash in migration script if a bio-reactor had no recipe set. (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5f36deb43b315081c5dd4496)

  Info:
    - All changes from 0.18.27 are also available for Factorio 0.17 (version 0.17.58).

  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed crash when recipes for liquid air and nitrogen don't exist because alternatives from other mods are used instead. (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5f369b1c4026d79854f0dad9)
    - Fixed crash with Factorio 1.0 because of an error in the version checks. (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5f366429002cac73f72966f2, https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5f36a8d13b315081c5d2f903)

  Changes:
    - Pretty-formatted the rest of the code. Making it more readable makes it easier to maintain, and it doesn't hurt either that removing unnecessary white space shrinks filesizes a bit. :-)
    - The internal names of the recipes "bi-biomass-2" and "bi-biomass-3" were not appropriate as "bi-biomass-2" was the more advanced recipe. Exchanged the recipe names in the complete code, and added a migration script so that bio-reactors would continue to work on the correct recipe after loading.

  Info:
    - All changes from 0.18.26 are also available for Factorio 0.17 (version 0.17.57).

  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed crash in migration script of versions 0.17.55/0.18.24. (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5f1613573883b1bffadfbdd2)
    - Fixed that placing musk floor would mine existing path tile and remove the musk floor tiles from the inventory, but not place them. (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5f1613573883b1bffadfbdd2)
    - In games where many mods are used and where more than 255 tiles are defined, Alien Biomes will convert some tiles to "landfill". Fixed that this would break musk-floor tiles.
    - Fixed crash because of Nitrogen and Liquid air being created in data-final-fixes.lua. (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5f31f7ba75ce84907a09f877, https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5f330890606ff2dea2e30c02)

  Uploaded by:
    - Pi-C

  Info:
    - All changes from 0.18.25 are also available for Factorio 0.17 (version 0.17.56).

  Changes:
    - Added setting to enable the BI recipe for Production science packs. You may want to disable this if you play with other mods where the additional recipe is much cheaper than the first one, so that using the BI recipe would break the balance.
    - The BI recipe for Production science pack will be automatically disabled regardless of the setting above if "Krastorio" or "Krastorio 2" is active because the BI recipe definitely breaks balance with K2 (according to TheSAguy).

    - If you are feeling adventurous, you can be an early adopter of the new Bio Cannon! Instructions are included in the file "_README".
      PLEASE NOTE: THIS WILL ONLY WORK WITH FACTORIO >=0.18.33!

  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed connection issue with Powered rails. (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5eac04c6e0fdb1000c437b88/edit/3)
    - Hopefully also fixed the big lag caused by placing powered rails with the connection fix. (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5efcd751acf8d21414888772)
    - Fixed that icon for the Nitrogen recipe wasn't the same as the icon for the fluid.

  Changes:
    - The recipe for sand from crushed stone is now also active if the "BioTech" mod is used. (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5efbea86a9fc8de786653d1d)
    - Added migration script to rewire powered rails. If you have a large rail network with lots of powered rails and then some, this may take a while to finish!

  Info:
    - All changes from 0.18.22 are also available for Factorio 0.17 (version 0.17.53).

  Bugfixes:
    - I was so focused on "Transport Drones" removing "object-layer" from all rail collision masks that I forgot to add it as default it "Transport Drones" wasn't active. That caused crashes with "Beautiful Bridge Railway" and "Cargo Ships" -- and probably other mods as well. Sorry for the inconvenience!

  Info:
    - All changes from 0.18.21 are also available for Factorio 0.17 (version 0.17.52).

  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that wooden rail bridges had a wrong collision mask after the last change, so they couldn't be built in their natural habitat (on water) anymore. The same has been reported for powered rails, but as these are just rails (not bridges), it doesn't make sense to build them on water.  (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5eee120d28bd58000f43d007)

  Changes:
    - Added hidden optional dependency on "Transport Drones", so if it's active and changes the collision mask of BI rails, the damage can be reverted in such a way that it's possible to build wooden bridges across water, but not through cliffs.

  Info:
    - All changes from 0.18.20 are also available for Factorio 0.17 (version 0.17.51).

  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that wooden underground pipes were not fast-replaceable via upgrade planner (found by TheSAguy).
    - Fixed that wooden rails had a wrong collision mask, so trains could drive through cliffs (found by TheSAguy).

  Changes:
    - Reverted change from 0.17.49/0.18.17: If "Angel's Petro Chemical Processing" is active, Basic Petroleum gas processing will output Methane gas again because it doesn't make sense that our recipe is the only one that will produce Petroleum gas (suggested by TheSAguy).

  Locale:
    - Renamed "Basic Petroleum gas processing" to "Basic gas processing" so the recipe name will still fit even if another mods (e.g. "Angel's Petro Chemical Processing") changes the result.

  Modding:
    - Migrated recipe "bi-basic-petroleum-gas-processing" to "bi-basic-gas-processing".
    - Changed filename of icon from "bi_basic_petroleum_gas_processing.png" to "bi_basic_gas_processing.png".

Version: 0.18.17
Date: 2020-06-06
  Uploaded by:
    - Pi-C

  Info:
    - All changes are also available for Factorio 0.17 (version 0.17.49).

  Changes:
    - Added some logic to data stage code so that the same code can be used for Factorio 0.17 and 0.18 (concerns icon size, particles, and sound definitions).
    - Changed icons to 64x64. Tanks to TheSAguy for providing these!
    - By request of TheSAguy, it now takes just half the time to craft Bio-Nurseries (2.5 normal, 4 expensive) and Bio-Farms (5 normal, 7.5 expensive). I've also halved the time needed to mine wooden floor.
    - If "Krastorio 2" is active, the recipes for Nitrogen and Liquid air will now be removed from "Bio Industries". (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5e713a510e1f16000e1f6b0b)
    - Recipes for Nitrogen and Liquid air will also be removed if "Krastorio" (for 0.17) or "Angel's Petro Chemical Processing" are active.
    - If "Angel's Petro Chemical Processing" is active, revert that it changes the result of Basic petroleum gas processing from Petroleum gas to Methane gas.
    - TheSAguy just added some mips, so items on belts don't look too monotonous.

  Bugfixes:
    - Prototype artillery and terraformer could be built directly or with the pipette tool. However, they wouldn't be blueprinted correctly (wrong entity was used), so the hidden entities were not created and things didn't work. Fixed that!

  Major Features:
    - TheSAguy provided a patch that adds a new recipe: "Inefficient Petroleum gas extraction". You now can generate the petroleum you'll need for BI from coal, resin, and steam. Thanks a lot!

  Info:
    - All changes are also available for Factorio 0.17 (version 0.17.45).

  Bugfixes:
    - The migration script from 0.18.11 contained a bug that could lead to a crash on loading a saved game. Removed the old migration script and included a fixed version of it under a new name. (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5e8d787758a9e4000f9f9f65)
    - Fixed a crash on startup with "Xander Mod". (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5e9326ab5ca918000bb48584)
    - Fixed that the localization strings for the coal-processing technologies were commented out in the Russian locale.

  Changes:
    - Added startup setting allowing to hide electric grid overlay for Musk floor in map view again. (Basically, this reverts to the same display of Musk floor that was used before version 0.18.9 because of a bug -- but now it's feature!)

      Please note:
      - Hiding the overlay will always work.
      - Displaying the overlay will work in new games and for any musk floor you build after updating the mod. In singleplayer games, it will also work for existing tiles.
      - In multiplayer games, it's impossible to determine which force an existing musk floor tile belongs to, so the overlay won't be displayed for existing tiles. It will work, however, for newly built tiles. (Therefore, you can solve this problem by deconstructing old musk floor tiles and rebuilding them.)

    - Added startup setting that allows to turn off small collision boxes for trees on user request. I'm not sure if this will change anything in terms of balancing tree growth, so consider this experimental for now! (https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?p=490610#p490610)

  Changes:
    - Add solar cells to the recipe of Musk floor if "Simple Silicon" is active. Musk floor works with solar power, so it's just natural that solar cells should go in there. Also, this change provides another sink for all the silicon (or for stone, which can be processed to make silicon).

    - TheSAguy asked me (Pi-C) to look after his mod for a while, so this is my first release of a "Bio Industries" update.
    - All changes are also available for Factorio 0.17 (version 0.17.35).

  Uploaded by:
    - Pi-C

  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed inconsistency in labels of unlocked recipes for Biofuel Conversion 2, 3. (https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=80546)

    - Fixed that terraformers wouldn't plant on landfill. (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5e1bd9b7e60b78000d1b8c1b)

    - Fixed that terraformers couldn't be blueprinted. (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5dbbf3f05ba8c1000ccf008a)

    - Fixed that names of items and recipes didn't match. (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5ca1534d3f02c6000d51b9b8)

    - Bumped dependency on Factorio Standard Library (stdlib) to >=1.4.0. (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5e34215f78fa0a000c20822c)

  Changes:
    - Changed prerequisite technologies for Coal processing 2 (added Chemical science pack) and 3 (added Production science pack). (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5dcd0fa3797d9c000cb993f2)

    - Added recipes to make crushed stone from Concrete, Hazard concrete and their refined-concrete counterparts. They can be made in the stone crusher after "Advanced Material Processing 2" has been researched (processing stone takes 1.5s, vs. 2.5s for concrete/hazard concrete; processing the refined-concrete varieties will yield twice the amount, but take twice the time). I've also added "Concrete" to the prerequisites of "Advanced Material Processing 2". (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5e11565b6cc0eb000b9732bc)

    - If Dectorio is installed, you won't be able any longer to place wood on the ground as wooden flooring. However, any existing wooden flooring will remain in place and can be mined (returning wood). (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5d7e610164c43b000c4e23a6)

    - Reduced supply area of Big wooden pole (4x4 to 3x3) and Huge electric pole (4x4 to 2x2). Also changed name of "Huge electric pole" to "Huge wooden pole" for consistency. (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5d7d35d2e18d8c000bb016c0/edit_title)

    - Removed fuel value from ash.

    - Added bioreactor to blacklist of Assembler Pipe Passthrough to avoid crashes on migration because of mixing fluids. (It used to be blacklisted in APP already, but with the changes to prototype names it's easier if we blacklist our own stuff directly.)

    - Changed icon for recipe of Bio battery -- it still used the battery icon from Factorio 0.16.x.

    - Changed graphics for Power-to-rail connector. Now it resembles a medium electric pole (like in the icon) -- not a small electric pole.

    - Allow productivity modules when making Production science packs with the BI recipe. (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5da3445450a256000b56f116)

    - Unified format of datestrings and merged categories "Bugfix:"/"Bugfixes:" in the changelog.

  Locale:
    - Changed item-description of "Change terrain (advanced)" and "Change terrain & plant trees (advanced)" to explain the advantages over the basic recipe.

    - Changed a lot of prototype names. Check out migrations/Bio_Industries_0.18.01.json for a complete list of the new names!
