bi-bio-farm=__ENTITY__bi-bio-farm__s are where __ENTITY__seedling__s grow into trees that are processed to __ITEM__wood__ and __ITEM__bi-woodpulp__. An integrated solar panel provides some of the energy during the day.
bi-bio-garden=The __ENTITY__bi-bio-garden__ scrubs pollution from the air.
bi-bio-garden-large=The __ENTITY__bi-bio-garden-large__ is like 9 __ENTITY__bi-bio-garden__s, but uses less fertilizer and cleans more air.
bi-bio-garden-huge=The __ENTITY__bi-bio-garden-huge__ is like 9 __ENTITY__bi-bio-garden-large__s, but uses less fertilizer and cleans more air.
bi-bio-greenhouse=Just the right place to grow __ITEM__bi-seed__s and __ENTITY__seedling__s.
bi-bio-reactor=__ENTITY__bi-bio-reactor__s produce and process __1__.
bi-cokery=The __ENTITY__bi-cokery__ processes __ITEM__wood__ and __ITEM__bi-woodpulp__ into ash and various fuels.
bi-stone-crusher=__ENTITY__bi-stone-crusher__s can crush __ITEM__stone__, __ITEM__stone-brick__s, __ITEM__concrete__ etc.

bi-bio-solar-farm-hidden-pole=Each __ENTITY__bi-bio-solar-farm__ is on a separate power network that can be [color=yellow][font=default-semibold]merged with other power networks[/font][/color] by wiring the connector. It will be connected to [color=yellow][font=default-semibold]additional power networks[/font][/color] (unless there also is a __ITEM__copper-cable__ connection) if it is within their supply area. The power will be split evenly between [color=yellow][font=default-semibold]all networks[/font][/color] -- even those that don't consume anything!
