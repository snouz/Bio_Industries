[entity-description]

## Production
bi-arboretum=__ENTITY__bi-arboretum__s change the surrounding terrain with fertilizer and/or plant trees.
bi-bio-farm=__ENTITY__bi-bio-farm__s are where __ENTITY__seedling__s grow into trees that are processed to __ITEM__wood__ and __ITEM__bi-woodpulp__. An integrated solar panel provides some of the energy during the day.
bi-bio-garden=The __ENTITY__bi-bio-garden__ scrubs pollution from the air.
bi-bio-garden-large=The __ENTITY__bi-bio-garden-large__ is like 9 __ENTITY__bi-bio-garden__s, but uses less fertilizer and cleans more air.
bi-bio-garden-huge=The __ENTITY__bi-bio-garden-huge__ is like 9 __ENTITY__bi-bio-garden-large__s, but uses less fertilizer and cleans more air.
bi-bio-greenhouse=Just the right place to grow __ITEM__bi-seed__s and __ENTITY__seedling__s.
bi-bio-reactor=__ENTITY__bi-bio-reactor__s produce and process __1__.
bi-cokery=The __ENTITY__bi-cokery__ processes __ITEM__wood__ and __ITEM__bi-woodpulp__ into ash and various fuels.
bi-stone-crusher=__ENTITY__bi-stone-crusher__s can crush __ITEM__stone__, __ITEM__stone-brick__s and __ITEM__concrete__.
bi-pollution-sensor=Returns a signal of pollution particles in a chunk.

## Power
bi-bio-accumulator=One __ENTITY__bi-bio-accumulator__ stores as much power as 60 __ENTITY__accumulator__s.
bi-bio-boiler=Twice as fast as a normal __ENTITY__boiler__ while polluting half as much.
bi-bio-solar-farm=Equivalent of 60 __ENTITY__solar-panel__s on a 9x9 space.
bi-huge-substation=Distributes power in a 50 tiles radius.
bi-solar-boiler=Generates steam using solar energy during the day and electricity during the night.
bi-solar-mat=__ENTITY__solar-panel__ in the form of pavement (10kW/tile) that also accelerates players.
bi-bio-solar-farm-hidden-pole=Each __ENTITY__bi-bio-solar-farm__ is on a separate power network that can be [color=yellow][font=default-semibold]merged with other power networks[/font][/color] by wiring the connector. It will be connected to [color=yellow][font=default-semibold]additional power networks[/font][/color] (unless there also is a __ITEM__copper-cable__ connection) if it is within their supply area. The power will be split evenly between [color=yellow][font=default-semibold]all networks[/font][/color] -- even those that don't consume anything!

## Weaponry
bi-bio-cannon=[color=yellow][font=default-semibold]No manual targeting.[/font][/color]
bi-dart-turret=Darts are cheaper and weaker than bullets, but are cheaper and fire at a higher rate and range.

## Rail stuff
bi-power-to-rail-pole=Connects __ENTITY__bi-rail-power__s to a power grid.
bi-rail-power=Also conducts electricity when connected to a power grid with a __ENTITY__bi-power-to-rail-pole__.
bi-rail-wood-bridge=Rail that goes on water.\n[color=yellow][font=default-semibold]Can only be crossed by trains.[/font][/color]
